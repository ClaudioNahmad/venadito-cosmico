II. Syncing a fork

	https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

	1. Fetch branches and commits from upstream repo
		 > git fetch upstream

	2. Check-out your fork's local master branch (change to 'master' branch)
		 > git checkout master
	
	3. Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch. 
	   This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.

		 > git merge upstream/master
	
	TIP! syncing your fork only updates your LOCAL copy of the repo, to update your github fork you must PUSH your changes

III. Create a new branch

	https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches

	1. > git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
	2. > git checkout [name_of_your_new_branch]
	3. > git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
	4. > git push --set-upstream origin [name_of_your_new_branch] (venadito1.0)

	5. Each time an add&commit&push is made:
		> git push origin venadito1.0
